# OPC Viewer

A simple Electron app to visualize [OpenPixelControl](https://github.com/zestyping/openpixelcontrol) messages without
the need of hardware.

Very basic with not much functionality other than just simulating a single [FadeCandy](https://github.com/scanlime/fadecandy) 
with channels 1 - 8.
